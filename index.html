<h1 id="disclaimer">disclaimer</h1>
<p>this is way i have learned the game is like. but i am bronze and not very good at the game. there also exist many other interpretations of game. also many diff ways to play game. the fun of game is u can play so many diff ways!</p>
<h1 id="fundamentals">fundamentals</h1>
<h2 id="objective-of-game">objective of game</h2>
<p>gather many money and exp to be strong to kill ppl so u can kill their buildings</p>
<h2 id="money">money</h2>
<p>u get money by ‘last hitting’ minions. ‘last hit’ is u are the last one to hit minion causing it to die.</p>
<p>money is valuble because u can buy items which make u strong</p>
<p>minions spawn in waves from ur base.</p>
<p>you can also get money by killing/help killing ppl.</p>
<h2 id="exp">exp</h2>
<p>u get exp for being around minions when they die</p>
<p>exp is valuble because it makes u level up which makes u strong</p>
<h2 id="auto-attacks">auto attacks</h2>
<p>all champs have an ‘auto attack’ (also called ‘autos’ or ‘attacks’)</p>
<p>autos r very important because theyre used a lot for last-hitting.</p>
<p>they also scale with various stats like AD (attack damage) and crit, and a lot of champs are basically just autos that kill everything!!</p>
<p>there are diff ways you can perform ‘auto attack’</p>
<p>note: auto-attacks are bound by ‘attack speed’ stat, so clicking/pressing more doesn’t make ur champ attack faster.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>just right click on something
<ul>
<li>this is usually not recommended because u also use right click for moving around and thats a lot of right clicks and is kinda easy to eventually misclick</li>
</ul></li>
<li>‘Player Attack Move’
<ul>
<li>the default key for this is ‘A’ i think. if u press the key, it will bring up a range indicator with where u can attack. u can left-click something, and it will auto-attack it for u.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>‘Player Attack Move Click’
<ul>
<li>has weird default bind so is worth rebinding. if u press the key, it should make ur champ auto the thing closest to ur cursor.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>autos are automatic so once u auto something once ur champ will keep hitting and following the target automatically. this is cool, but it doesnt move in most efficient way, so u usually want to just auto once, move around while u cant auto in the meantime, and then auto again whenever.</p>
<p><em>but</em> if you start moving too soon after autoing, itll cancel the attack!! oh no!</p>
<p>but as long as u get in rythym u should be good</p>
<p>here is an example of manually autoing once, moving, autoing again, etc. i autoed 5 times, but only 4 attacks came out because the second one cancelled. <video src='./manual.webm' controls></video></p>
<p>here is an example of just autoing once and letting champ automatically moving+attacking. note how champ sometimes awkwardly just chases after the target bc is not very efficient <video src='./auto.webm' controls></video></p>
<h2 id="abilities">abilities</h2>
<p>there are too many abilities to explain tbh just read tooltips and play around i still dont even know how a ton work</p>
<h2 id="last-hitting-demonstration">last-hitting demonstration</h2>
<p>here is demonstration using all concepts so far!! here are notes about minions that died:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>last-hit with auto-attack</li>
<li>last-hit with auto-attack</li>
<li>last-hit with ability</li>
<li>last-hit with auto-attack</li>
<li>failed to last-hit (autoed too early) (note: still got exp)</li>
<li>last-hit with auto-attack</li>
<li>last-hit with auto-attack. hit level 2 with its exp!! (you can see exp progress as the purple circle bar thing next to ur champs portrait on bottom)</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="objectives-and-stuff">objectives and stuff</h1>
<h2 id="turrets">turrets</h2>
<p>turrets attack you if</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>there is nothing else to attack, or</li>
<li>you hurt an enemy champ</li>
</ol>
<p>(enemy) turrets deal a lot of damage, so u usually want to only be near them when destroying them with help of your minions, or when using ur best judgement.</p>
<p>likewise, u are usually safe underneath your own turret.</p>
<h2 id="visionwardstrinkets">vision/wards/trinkets</h2>
<p>vision in league is very powerful!!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>you can only auto things that u can see</li>
<li>you can see where enemy team is (and plan accordingly)</li>
<li>you can hide from ur enemy</li>
</ol>
<p>here are the vision trinkets in the game: 1. yellow (ward) (default one) - you can use it to place a ‘ward’ that is like a little light that lets you see in a bush or area for a while. - your wards are (basically) hidden from enemies 2. red (sweeper) - you can use it and it goes whrrrr and then for a while all enemy wards around you will be revealed and disabled. 3. blue (long ward) - is like yellow except you can place it really far and it’s not hidden from enemies and the cooldown is much longer</p>
<h2 id="objectives">objectives</h2>
<p>top and bot-side river each have a pit with some kind of monster.</p>
<p>top-side pit has ‘rift herald’ which if u kill it lets u spawn big thing that helps you destroys enemy buildings. later in game it has ‘baron’ which if u kill it it makes ur minions super buff (which helps you destroy enemy buildings).</p>
<p>bot-side pit has ‘dragon’s which if u kill gives different kind of bonus/buffs to your team. if u kill 4 u get big buff. late in game ’elder dragon’ spawns which gives ur team an execute buff which is supposed to let u kill everyone to finish game</p>
<p>you can see timers for these objecitves when u press tab at the top. you can also memorize a bunch of times but yeah idk im bronze</p>
<h2 id="inhibs">inhibs</h2>
<p>each base has 3 ‘inhibitors’ which when broken make enemy base spawn ‘super minions’ which are a pain to deal with (though they do give a lot of gold)</p>
<h1 id="teamwork-lanes">teamwork, lanes</h1>
<p>unfortunately, it is very hard to win a game without any help.</p>
<h2 id="roaming">roaming</h2>
<p>roaming is when person from one lane leaves and goes to diff lane to help that diff lane kill someone.</p>
<p>usually ppl will only go one lane over (e.g. mid-&gt;bot or top, top-&gt;mid, bot-&gt;mid) to avoid being away from lane too long and losing exp/gold, though with ‘teleport’ summoner spell sometimes can go far (e.g. top tp bot)</p>
<h2 id="top">top</h2>
<p>top lane usually for ppl with a bunch of health. top laners usually good at getting towers and starting team fights</p>
<h2 id="mid">mid</h2>
<p>mid lane usually for ppl with burst damage. usually good at ig killing people? getting picks so u can push lanes</p>
<h2 id="adcbot">adc/bot</h2>
<p>usually for ranged champs that build attack damage and auto attack ppl to death. usually good at killing people (sustained damage) to win team fights. also provides good damage for killing objectives</p>
<p>ADC = (attack damage) carry = person that build attack damage and carries team with their damage</p>
<h2 id="support">support</h2>
<p>plays a duo lane with adc. usually have health and/or some utility abilities that help get kills. also sometimes roams to help other lanes. good at managing/directing team fights</p>
<p>support have special ‘support items’ that give them money in special ways, so they rarely last-hit, unless it’s part of their support item ‘quest’ or just nobody else is around</p>
<h2 id="jungle">jungle</h2>
<p>the ‘jungle’ role is basically like laning in the jungle where jungle monsters are minions and roaming is part of job description.</p>
<p>junglers take ‘smite’ summoner spell which helps kill jungle monsters.</p>
<p>no real other defining characteristics</p>
<h2 id="pings">pings</h2>
<p>you can communicate with ur team quickly with ‘pings’. main ping key is called ‘alert ping’ in hotkey settings and is default bound to g. you press g and either click something, or click and drag to use popup menu.</p>
<p>you can also ping stuff in tab display just by clicking on it (no keypress required)</p>
<p>some common things u might want to ping:</p>
<ul>
<li>ur cooldowns</li>
<li>missing enemy (e.g. warning ur top laner that enemy mid is prob roaming top)</li>
<li>an enemy, signalling u want to focus kill them</li>
<li>idk theres a bunch just trust me</li>
</ul>
<p>besides ‘alert ping’, theres also ‘retreat’ and ‘area is warded’ ping which are used slightly less and u can find in hotkeys settings.</p>
<h1 id="random-other-stuff">random other stuff</h1>
<h2 id="runes">runes</h2>
<p>runes are like special stats/effects u can choose at the start of each game.</p>
<p>theres rlly no other way to understand them except by reading the tooltips</p>
<h2 id="summoner-spells">summoner spells</h2>
<p>summoner spells are like special abilities u can choose at the start of each game. they have long cooldowns. read tooltips.</p>
<h2 id="bounties-and-assists-and-kill-gold-stuff">bounties and assists and kill gold stuff</h2>
<p>you get full kill gold if you last hit an enemy. you get ‘assist’ kill gold if you helped kill 10 secs before</p>
<p>enemies that have died a lot already are worth less money</p>
<p>enemies that have killed a lot of ppl have a ‘bounty’ (shown on tab scoreboard) which can be collected by last hitting them.</p>
<h2 id="wavelane-management">wave/lane management</h2>
<p>minions spawn in waves. they stop and attack each other. and thus u can shift the position of where the minions are fighting to be to your advantage. e.g. you can make them fight right in front of ur tower, and then just stand in front of them so that enemy cant last hit or get exp. or u can make big wave and then crash into enemy tower to help destroy it.</p>
<p>idk much else but theres prob a lot more to be said</p>
<h2 id="turret-diving">turret diving</h2>
<p>turrets can only attack one thing at a time, so a teamwork to kill an enemy champion is to ‘dive’.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>someone with health hits enemy and thus takes ‘turret aggro’ (turret starts attacking them)
<ul>
<li>usually starts walking away bc turret hurts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>someone(s) with damage kills enemy without worry of turret killing them</li>
<li>leave turret</li>
</ol>
<p>i dont think its very common bc it requires too much teamwork but im like bronze and it still happens sometimes so ig is worth mentioning. is also worth mentioning the concept because a lot of ppl will just run into turret thinking they can solo kill and take turret aggro anyway so ig minus as well get free assist</p>
